# Tasks

**Work in Progress** - Full docs coming in the next few weeks! Until then, the [docs](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.0/Task) will give a partial overview.

Think of a task as a todo list. Like if you need to make a doctor's appointment there are a series of steps you follow: **Call the doctor's office, schedule a time, show up at that time, wait around for a while, see the doctor.** Okay, are you sitting in front of a doctor right now? No! Tasks in Elm are like tasks in real life. Just because you *describe* a task does not mean you *did* the task. Elm is not that magical.
