# Maybe

Tons of languages have a concept of `null`. Any time you think you have a `String` you just might have a `null` instead. Should you check? Did the person giving you the value check? Maybe it will be fine? Maybe it will crash your servers? I guess we will find out later!

The inventor, Tony Hoare, has this to say about it:

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language (ALGOL W). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.

Elm sidesteps this problem entirely with a type called `Maybe`. You can think of it as making `null` explicit, so we *know* if we have to handle it.

```elm
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

Notice that this type takes an argument `a` that we can fill in with any type we want. We can have types like `(Maybe Int)` which is either `Just` an integer or it is `Nothing`. For example, say we want to parse months from strings.

```elm
String.toInt : String -> Result String Int


toMonth : String -> Maybe Int
toMonth rawString =
    case String.toInt rawString of
      Err message ->
          Nothing

      Ok n ->
          if n > 0 && n <= 12 then Just n else Nothing
```

The contract for `toMonth` explicitly tells everyone that it will give back an integer *or* it won't! You never have to wonder if there is a `null` value sneaking around.

This may seem like a subtle improvement, but imagine all the code you have where you defensively added a `null` check just in case someone else behaves badly. Having contracts means you have a guarantee that a caller won't send you bad data! This is a world where you never again have to spend 4 hours debugging a null pointer exception!
