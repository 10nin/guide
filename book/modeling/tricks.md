- shuffling

```elm
{ x : String, y : Bool }

(String, Bool)
  -- (a, True)   ==> On a
  -- (b, False)  ==> Off b

type X = On String | Off String

type X = On String | Off String Y
```

- Maybe callback start/stop exercise from clock example? Show people `type Clock = Running Time.Posix | Paused` and variations?
