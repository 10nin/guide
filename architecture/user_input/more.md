# More About User Input

We only covered buttons and text fields, but there are other kinds of input that you will need eventually:

- [Checkboxes](https://elm-lang.org/examples/checkboxes)
- [Radio Buttons](https://elm-lang.org/examples/radio-buttons)

Visit [the examples page](https://elm-lang.org/examples) for even more examples. It is all variations on stuff we have learned in this tutorial already, so playing with these examples is a great way to practice and become more comfortable with what you have learned so far. Maybe try incorporating check boxes into the form example?

That said, I want to keep up the momentum of this tutorial and keep introducing new concepts, so next we will be looking at how to work with things like HTTP and websockets.
