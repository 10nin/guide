# Time

We are going to make a simple clock.

So far we have focused on commands. With the randomness example, we *asked* for a random value. With the HTTP example, we *asked* for info from a server. That pattern does not really work for a clock. Instead we want to sit around and hear about clock ticks whenever they happen. This is where **subscriptions** come in.

The code is not to crazy here, so I am going to include it in full. After you read through, we will come back to normal words that explain it in more depth.

```elm
