# More about The Elm Architecture

The emphasis of this section has been: **how can we get people making cool Elm projects as quickly and smoothly as possible?** So we covered:

  - The basic architecture pattern.
  - How to create buttons and text fields.
  - How to make HTTP requests.
  - How to work with web sockets.

You can go quite far with this foundation! So we are going to take a break from The Elm Architecture for a couple chapters to get a better understanding of Elm itself. We will come back to The Elm Architecture in the [Modularity](../modularity/README.md) chapter. That is when we will start learning how to structure large projects and applications.
